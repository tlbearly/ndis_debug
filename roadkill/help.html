<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Q:  </strong>What land is open to public hunting?<BR>
<strong>A:  </strong>Unfortunately the issue of hunting access in Colorado is somewhat difficult to map.  The 'Land Management (COMaP v8)' layer portrays who, at the time of the data release, was responsible for managing a particular piece of property.  It has nothing to do with how a land manager regulates that property.  As an example, the Forest Service might be the land manager, but certain parts of the forest could be closed to hunting and keeping track of how everyone in the state regulates a property is beyond the capability of Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW). If you are interested, you can find out more about the Colorado Ownership Management and Protection (COMaP) data at <a href="http://cnhpblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/cnhp-takes-over-maintenance-of-comap.html">http://cnhpblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/cnhp-takes-over-maintenance-of-comap.html</a>.

<p>Having said that, you can make some fairly strong inferences from Land Management data ('Land Management (COMaP v8)').  Most of Forest Service (USFS) property and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land is available for hunting.  'State' land tends to be a mixture and you are better off referring to the 'CDOW Public Access Properties' map layer.

<p>Again however, regulations are a separate matter from access.  CPW provides 'Fishing Access' which is publically accessible, but for the most part the properties aren't meant for hunting.  Most State Wildlife Areas (SWA) are available for hunting. 'State Trust Land' and 'Hunting Access (Non-STL)' provide seasonal hunting access. Check out the Land & Water page (<a href="http://cpw.state.co.us/aboutus/Pages/LandWater.aspx">http://cpw.state.co.us/aboutus/Pages/LandWater.aspx</a>) on the CPW website for more information on Wildlife Areas and the State Trust Land program.


<p><strong>Q:  </strong>Do you sell GMU maps?<BR>
<strong>A:  </strong>No, we do not sell GMU maps.  As much as we would like to, we are not funded or staffed to provide high quality maps for each Game Management Unit in the state.

<p><strong>Q:  </strong>Is there any way to get a downloadable version of the hunting atlas?<BR>
<strong>A:  </strong>No, the Hunting Atlas is a web based application and can not be downloaded.

<p><strong>Q:  </strong>What about the data?  Can you provide me with the Hunting Atlas data?<BR>
<strong>A:  </strong>You can find most of our data on ArcGIS.com by searching 'GROUPS' for 'Colorado Parks and Wildlife' or by following this link, 
<a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=Colorado%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife&t=groups"><strong>Colorado Parks and Wildlife on ArcGIS.com</strong></a>.  

<p><strong>Q:  </strong>What does 'Winter Concentration Area' really mean?<BR>
<strong>A:  </strong>All of our species data is explained on our <a href="definitions.html">Big Game Map Information</a> page.

<p><strong>Q:  </strong>What does SWA, STL, SFU, WWA, and GMU stand for?<BR>
<strong>A:  </strong>SWA=State Wildlife Area<br/>
<span style="position:relative;left:22px;">STL=State Trust Land<br/>
SFU=State Fishing Unit<br/>
WWA=Watch-able Wildlife Area<br/>
GMU=Game Management Unit<br/></span>
