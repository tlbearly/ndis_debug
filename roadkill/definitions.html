<p class="content"><b>MIGRATION PATTERN:</b>  A subjective indication of the general direction of the movements of migratory ungulate herds.<br><br>
<b>MIGRATION CORRIDOR:</b>  A specific mappable site through which large numbers of animals migrate and loss of which would change migration routes.<br><br>
<b>WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA:</b>  That part of the winter range of a species where densities are at least 200% greater than the surrounding winter range density during the same period used to define winter range in the average five winters out of ten.<br><br>
<b>WINTER RANGE:</b>  That part of the overall range of a species where 90 percent of the individuals are located during the average five winters out of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring green-up, or during a site specific period of winter as defined for each DAU.<br><br>
<b>SUMMER RANGE:</b>  That part of the range of a species where 90% of the individuals are located between spring green-up and the first heavy snowfall, or during a site specific period of summer as defined for each DAU.  Summer range is not necessarily exclusive of winter range; in some areas winter range and summer range may overlap.<br><br>
<b>RESIDENT POPULATION AREA:</b>  An area used year-round by a population of elk.  Individuals could be found in any part of the area at any time of the year; the area cannot be subdivided into seasonal ranges.  It is most likely included within the overall range of the larger population.<br><br>
<b>OVERALL RANGE:</b>  The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the observed range of an elk population. <br>

<b>OVERALL RANGE:</b>  The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the observed range of a mule deer population. <br>
